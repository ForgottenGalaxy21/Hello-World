# Hello-World

Hi there!


Uhm i guess im artistic... most of the electives i take are all in the artistic range. I listen to a lot of remixes and "dubstep".
In my spare time i like to draw, play videogames, and watch youtube. I have lots of siblings that are mostly annoying.
I played alot of games not only that but i watch youtubers play games so in the future i can play it.
I used to think up of a lot games and just think that I would like to build that.
now im learning how.....yup
